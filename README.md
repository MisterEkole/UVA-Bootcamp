# UVA-Bootcamp 2022

This repository contains all codes for the UVA Training Bootcamp on Introduction to machine learning and introduction computer vision with deep learning hosted by Mitterand Ekole.
The various machine learning algorithms covered here include: linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest classifier, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor,
neural networks. For deep learning: peceptron, multilayer peceptron and convolutional neural networks.
Three major projects were built, they include a blood smear analyser with CNN, Cats and Dog Classifier with CNN, Object Tracking and Detection with DJI Tello Drone using pretrained CNN.
